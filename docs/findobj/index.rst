findobj
=======

It is likely that ``findobj`` will eventually be merged into
`photutils <http://photutils.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ or
`astropy`_.

.. warning::
    ``findobj`` requires `astropy`_ version 0.3.0 (or newer).

.. warning::
    ``findobj`` is currently a work-in-progress, and thus it is
    possible there will be significant API changes in later versions.
